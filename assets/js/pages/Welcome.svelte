    <h1>Welcome to your example application</h1>
    <p>
        In order to get started, change the files in the folder <span class="highlight">assets/js/pages</span> and adjust them to your needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">"App.svelte"</span> Component serves as the Frontend entrypoint for the application.
    </p>
    <p> 
        <span class="highlight">"DefaultController.php"</span> (residing beneath <span class="highlight">src/Controller</span>) serves as main routing proxy for the backend, 
        handling incoming requests. You can, however, specify your own Controllers.
